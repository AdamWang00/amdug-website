                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/drp">The Directed Reading Program</a> is an independent reading program hosted by the Brown Division of Applied Mathematics. The overview of the program is as follows: "The Directed Reading Program provides undergraduates with the opportunity to work one-on-one with graduate students and post-docs in the Division of Applied Mathematics (APMA) on independent reading projects. It is a fantastic opportunity for motivated undergraduates to learn new mathematical & computational skills, forge connections with graduate students, and explore higher level mathematics outside of the undergraduate curriculum."<p>

                <p>The Brown Division of Applied Mathematics hosts the annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/siam/bmcm.html">Brown Mathematical Contest for Modeling</a>. The overview of the program is as follows: "The BMCM is a competition where a team of three undergraduates creates, analyzes, and writes a report on a mathematical model for an open-ended real world problem over the span of a weekend. Faculty, postdocs and graduate students in the Division of Applied Mathematics will then judge the reports on merits such as practicality of the model, and clarity of the report. The top 2 teams from the Brown competition will be sponsored by the Division of Applied Mathematics to compete in the International MCM Competition organized by COMAP. Students from all over the world participate in this contest!".</p>
