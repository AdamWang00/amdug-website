                <p class="desc">We understand that, at Brown, applied math is one of the most popular fields explored by students due to its joint concentrations with computer science, biology, and economics. We're proud to be part of a community of students with such unique backgrounds and a wide range of skills and interests.</p>
                <p class="desc">Our DUG's mission, as such, is to cater to students interested or concentrating in APMA by promoting diversity and inclusivity, hosting events for advising and learning, and creating opportunities for career development and networking. We invite you to explore our website, attend our student-hosted meetings, and <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/Mi73mUp8BgCeGzPs7">join our mailing list</a> to receive important updates about upcoming events and opportunities.</p>
